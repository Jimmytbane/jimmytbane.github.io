        Hey there, I'm jmfgdev, I'm usually learning and using <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://python.org/">Python</a>        and more recently, <a href="http://fsharp.org">F#</a> & <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>
        <br><br>I also try to involve myself in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.en.html"></a>
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html/">"Free Software"</a> movement, specifically, I'm currently
        contributing to <a href="https://libertybsd.net/">LibertyBSD.</a><br><br> I mostly post my code on <a href="https://github.com/jmfgdev/">GitHub</a>        for visibility<br>(I've put my code elsewhere but no one ever sees it, not even a star)<br><br> If you want to see
        my code without using any non-free software, you can contact me, or you can clone the repo url without ever looking
        at GitHub's site.<br>
